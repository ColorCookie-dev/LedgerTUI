-----------------------
For filling the ledger.csv with random data through the ignored test
fill_with_random_data, you need a names list, particularly the list
present at https://nlp100.github.io/data/popular-names.txt and save
to file at project root as popular-names.txt

then run the test with
cargo test fill_with_random_data -- --ignored
